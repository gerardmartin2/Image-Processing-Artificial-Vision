Explain any pre-processing/post-processing you do to the images/predictions.\n","5. Explain the losses you use to train or fine-tune your system.\n","6.

After all submission are received a leaderboard will be published.\n","\n","Good luck!\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["El model de dalt (model2), entrenat amb 20 èpoques i el dataset de Persones és el que hem usat per fer l'estudi, per tant no l'hem tornat a copiar baix."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-30T08:34:16.342727Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-30T08:34:16.341102Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-30T08:34:16.348890Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-30T08:34:16.347861Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-30T08:34:16.342677Z"},"id":"tcfqMx0-2XdP","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Make sure to change this for the path of the \"dataset_person/test\" folder and your group/team name\n","ZIPFILE = 'G12_E12'\n","TEST_FOLDER = \"/kaggle/input/personespiva/dataset_person/test/\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-30T08:41:31.875973Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-30T08:41:31.874952Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-30T08:42:47.157085Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-30T08:42:47.155992Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-30T08:41:31.875915Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Let's create fake predictions for the test images\n","from PIL import Image\n","import shutil\n","import random\n","import os\n","import plotly.graph_objects as go\n","\n","import torch\n","from torchvision import transforms\n","from PIL import Image\n","\n","# Use a seed to control random generation\n","r = random.Random(5)\n","\n","# Create the directory\n","out_path= os.path.join('/kaggle/working/','MASKS_PREDICTION')\n","os.makedirs(out_path, exist_ok=True)\n","\n","score_threshold = 0.75\n","\n","for f in open(os.path.join(TEST_FOLDER,'test_names.txt'),'r'):\n","    b = f.strip()\n","    # read test image\n","    img = Image.open(os.path.join(TEST_FOLDER,'images',b)+'.jpg')\n","    \n","    transform = transforms.ToTensor()\n","    img = transform(img)\n","    \n","    img = img.unsqueeze(0).to(device) #torch.stack((img,img))\n","    outs = model(img)\n","    \n","    scores = np.copy(outs[0][\"scores\"].cpu().detach().numpy())\n","    mask = np.copy(outs[0][\"masks\"].cpu().detach().numpy())\n","    \n","    wdth, hght = mask.shape[-1], mask.shape[-2]\n","    \n","    # Add mask if scores\n","    m = torch.zeros((hght, wdth)).cpu().numpy()\n","    \n","    for i in range(len(mask)):\n","        if scores[i] > score_threshold:\n","            m = m + mask[i]\n","            \n","    preds = m.squeeze()\n","    min_p, max_p = preds.min(), preds.max()\n","    \n","    preds = ((preds - min_p) / (max_p - min_p) * 255).astype(np.uint8)\n","    pred = Image.fromarray(preds, mode='L') \n","    \n","    pred.save(os.path.join(str(out_path),b)+'.png')\n","# zip all predictions\n","shutil.make_archive(ZIPFILE, 'zip', out_path)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-30T07:06:04.405492Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-30T07:06:04.405118Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-30T07:06:06.618072Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-30T07:06:06.617112Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-30T07:06:04.405457Z"},"id":"Juzcsuxz2zho","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Sample script to compute mean IoU of predictions in the TEST.
